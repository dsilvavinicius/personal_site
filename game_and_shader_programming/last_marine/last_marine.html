This is an early game prototype done using the Blender Game Engine and is a tribute for Blizard's Starcraft game series. I have created the mesh, animations and materials for the marine model, which is used as hero and enemies (just changed the material). The level modeling was also done by me with the proportional editing. I have used images from the Internet to make the main menu and skybox. The game logic was a mix of Blender's brick state approach and python scripts.

The source code is packed inside the .blender file which can be used to generate the binaries for Linux, Windows or whichever operating system Blender can run on. The project was done in Blender 2.49b and it seems that it is not automatically converted for newer version. There is available a file with binaries for Windows. This file has Python 2.6 libs bundled, so there should be no problems to execute it on any computer.
