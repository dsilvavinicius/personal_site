This is my first real computer graphics project and I have great affection for it. It is a simple study on capabilities of OpenGL for game development. It cannot be considered a game in fact, since I have not implemented an engine and in consequence there is no scene graph involved. The application is cross-platform and some simple game coding techniques like billboarding, animation in time and 3d models load were explored. The project uses Quake 2 md2 models.
